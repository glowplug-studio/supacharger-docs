# Updates 

## Setup

To run an update on the core do 

cd  project/ supacharger up -core

the cli will look for the folders and config and files if it can find then move up a directory?

we recommend not editing files in the supacharger directories if you do duplicate and rename the original .bak and the cli will apply updates to the .bak, you can then see what changed in youg git diff and manually apply change
